In src/org/usfirst/frc/team1683/ there are the following directories:

  * autonomous - controls the robot during its autonomous period
  * driverStation - screen that shows info about the robot
  * driveTrain - controls motors to form drive train
  * robot - the main class and ports
  * pneumatics - self explanatory
  * sensors - self explanatory
  * scoring - climbing, elevation, and grabbing mechanism
  * vision - takes values sent from raspberry pi
